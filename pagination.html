<p><b>What is Pagination?</b><br>
 Pagination is the process of separating print or digital content into discrete pages.<img src="https://www.edureka.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Image-Pagination-Angular-JS-Edureka.jpg" width="450px" height="200px">For print documents and some online content, pagination also refers to the automated process of adding consecutive numbers to identify the sequential order of pages. In other words, Pagination is a method of dividing web content into discrete pages, thus presenting content in a limited and digestible manner. This method is usually employed to display resulting items on a website. Google search results page is a typical example of such a search. It is also widely used on e-commerce websites.</p>
<p><b>Why is pagination needed?</b><br>
The Importance of Paging. Good choices about data paging are an important part of design and development. Sometimes we need to get lists of data from the server, and sometimes these lists can be really long. Breaking lists up into smaller, discreet "pages" can reduce server overhead and improve response time. Pagination is a required part of a reference to a book when you only use a specific part of the book for research. It indicates the specific point within a work at which the information to be referenced is located. You should make a reasonable effort to locate page numbers, they are often present in pdf documents.<br>Online articles are sometimes paginated to break up content. There is some justification to organizing long articles into multiple pages to aid the reader. However, even relatively brief articles are often paginated so that a page consists of a single paragraph and a visitor might have to click through ten or more pages to read the complete text. The purpose is to increase page views and, as a result, ad impressions -- the number of times that a website visitor sees a given ad. However, because most readers don't complete multi-page articles, the presentation of multiple short pages rather than a single long one may actually result in fewer ad impressions.

<p><b>How to make a Pagination?</b><br>
To create pagination for a page is quite simple, you can do that by using Bootstrap, JavaScript and simplest way that is HTML and CSS. Pagination is helpful when the web site contains lots of content on a single page, that a single page will not look good with all those topics together. Few websites use the scroll to avoid pagination and vice versa. But the best looks come with the combination of scroll and pagination. As a developer, you can put a few contents on a page to make that page a little scrollable until itâ€™s annoying. After that, you can use pagination that will leave those previous content and proceed to the new content page but the topic will be the same.</p>
<p><b>What Does a Paginator Do?</b><br>
A paginator is a person who is responsible for laying out the various pages of a newspaper, book, or other media project. In pagination, professionals assemble all of the content for a text or web project, and lay it out according to templates for numerical pages. The result is an ordered final product where each page includes specific content designated by the paginator. This usually includes a table of contents or other ordering index that has to be precisely ordered and checked for accuracy.
